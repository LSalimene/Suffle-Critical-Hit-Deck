# Suffle-Critical-Hit-Deck
For this project I want to make a site that gives random critical effects.

For now I only have the first idea that I made for my online RPG tabletop, but I want to make it better. First, I will re-write the primary code in Elixir, and then create effects in text that does not needs to buy the carts. Further I will make a website for make easy to use for everyone.

# How to use the code now?
You will need the code and card for the deck in a .JPG in the same directory, they need to be write like 's1.JPG' (s for critical hit and f for critical fumble). Im using the Pathfinder 2e decks
